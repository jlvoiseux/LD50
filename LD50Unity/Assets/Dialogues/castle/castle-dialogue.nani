RIGHTFUL-KING: What on Earth does this comedy mean? Who let you enter the Castle?
REVOLUTIONARY-LEADER: The people demand rights, my Liege! Or should I call you... Comrade King ?
RIGHTFUL-KING: Slience! This is outrageous, this is unfair, this is lese-majest√©! I am the sole ruler of the kingdom, by the will of God and the prestige of my lineage!
WHITE-KNIGHT: KING! What is happening here?
RIGHTFUL-KING: Oh WHITE KNIGHT, perfect timing. This scoundrel claims that the people, MY people, want to overrule me by electing a new sovereign. Can you believe it? And after all the trouble we went through to red rid of Darkness.
REVOLUTIONARY-LEADER: This cannot continue, Comrade. Your administation is corrupted. People are dying on the streets, and illiterate children are robbing the few lucky ones that still breathe. Your time is over.
RIGHTFUL-KING: Hogwash, nonsense! I AM the people. WHITE KNIGHT, lend me a hand. You are nobility, aren't you ?

RIGHTFUL-KING: And so, order is restored. Thank you for your help, my friend, the bloodline owes you a dear lot.
WHITE-KNIGHT: Aren't you being a little hard on him? He was backed by a fair number of people, from what I understand...
RIGHTFUL-KING: Well, now he stands as an example. As for the people, I am not worried in the least. History shows that these aspirations are nothing more than a temporary fad.
WHITE-KNIGHT: If you say so...
